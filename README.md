# led-ctrl-ws

LED control webserver and LED control daemon for pi, this really should be too repos, but I'm lazy!

# Installation

Installation requires sudo access, and WILL create a giant security hole in your system at the leds python daemon unfortunately must run as root

```sh
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc123me/led-ctrl-ws/refs/heads/master/leds-setup.sh"
chmod +x leds-setup.sh
./leds-setup.sh
```
